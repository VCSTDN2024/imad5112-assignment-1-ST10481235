 ## 6. Challenges and Learnings
During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges:

**Challenge 1**: The formatting of my if statements were hard to form as a layout.
**Solution**: With assistance from AI, it showed how to format my if statements in a proper manner.

**Challenge 2**: My application was having a problem running and did not want to run.
**Solution**: I  watched a youtube video showing me that I needed to connect to the bluestacks 5 first before opening android studio and once that has been opened, i was able to open android                studio and ensuring that the app was able to run.

From these challenges, i fully learnt how to properly run my app and how to comfortable use the if statements.

## 7. Future enhancements
Even though the current app provides the user with the key goal, there are many features that could be added to improve the application for the future.

**Feature 1:**: The application should've been able for users to schedule reminders or set notifcations for the application.
**Feature 2:** As well as allowing users to set dietary preferences to what they eat and what they do not eat.
**Feature 3:** Allowing users to be able to use dark mode to save batter usage.

These would improve the level of usability for the application in the future.
